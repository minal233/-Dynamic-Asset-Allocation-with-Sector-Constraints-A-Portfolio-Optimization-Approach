# Dynamic-Asset-Allocation-with-Sector-Constraints-A-Portfolio-Optimization-Approach
This project demonstrates portfolio optimization using an **Equal Weight Allocation** strategy. The analysis explores how distributing investment capital evenly across assets can serve as a simple yet effective portfolio construction method.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Portfolio optimization is a key concept in quantitative finance. While many strategies (e.g., mean-variance optimization, risk parity, or factor-based methods) rely on advanced statistical and mathematical models, equal weight allocation provides a **baseline benchmark** by distributing weights evenly among all selected assets.

This project:
- Explains the concept of equal-weighted portfolios.
- Shows how to construct such a portfolio with historical stock price data.
- Compares performance against alternative allocation strategies (if applicable).
- Provides visualizations for portfolio returns and risk analysis.
